# Car Price Prediction


In this project, I aimed to predict the prices of second-hand cars based on various features present in the dataset, whether they are numerical or categorical in nature. These features included the year of manufacture, the price of the car when it was new, the number of kilometers it has been driven, the type of fuel it uses, seller type, owner, and the transmission type.

To accomplish this, I used several regression techniques:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- Ridge
- ElasticNet
- Random Forests
- Decision Tree Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
